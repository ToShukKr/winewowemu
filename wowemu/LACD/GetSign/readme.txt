This is a new tool to easily produce a Cheats.ini signature.
Run the tool, it will scan for all running processes.
You can press the "eye" icon to refresh the list.

Look for the "bad" or unwanted program.
Back-click on it.
Lost Angle encrypted and CRC protected the file, as such, I don't feel like messing with it.
Instead of seeing something like, add to Cheats, you will likely see ??????????????.
Click the series of questionmarks to add the exe to the Cheats.ini lists.

Open the Cheats.ini
Copy the new entry(s)
Open in the server folder, Cheats.ini
Paste in the new entry(s).

Restart the LACD server and the updates will be ready.

Beebop.
