LAST UPDATE by BAD on 21.02.2006
==================================
21.02.2006 by BAD and tested by BAD

Paladin

18.02.2006 by Seatleason and not tested by BAD

Bugfixes to last update! The one seatleson posted above for rupture, and scare beast didn't always release on dmg.

Rogue
-Rupture 

Hunter
-Scare Beast

Warrior
-Intimidating Shout


15.02.2006 by Pinhow not tested by BAD

*TEMPORARY solution to hunter's traps:  The are directly placed on target and not on the ground.
Requirements for placing it on a target : Be very, very near the target and the target can't be moving or the spell will not take effect...
Another things: You can't trap a target that is sleeping or stunned, if you do it, the spell will not take effect...
The trap spells are doing 100% of what they do on original, the diference is that he doesn't place the trap on the ground...

Hunter
-Explosive Trap
-Freezing Trap Rank 1
-Freezing Trap Rank 2
-Freezing Trap Rank 3
-Immolation Trap Rank 1

Priest (Undead)
-Devouring Plague


14.02.2006 by BAD and tested by BAD

Paladin:

- Seal of Righteousness will have 50% chance to give additional holy damage if the target doesnt block, dodge, parry...Was 100%
- Seal of Command will have 50% chance to give additional holy damage if the target doesnt block, dodge, parry...Was 100%
- Seal of Justice is enable again but has 20% chance to stun if the target doesnt block, dodge, parry...Was 100%...The Stuned target cannot cast spells....

- Improved Seal of Justice are removed until of solution...

P.S I know that on Blizzard for Seals(excepting Seal of Crusader) the proc is based on weapon speed(if the weapon is slow, then the chance to do additional damage is higher; after my info is about 25-50% with 4 speed weapon and higher agility...

I cant make yet for proc so therefore I will add 50%..


P.S Remember that on 1.8.0 Seal of Justice with talents had a chance of 67% of its original value(base is 20% and with talents must be around 33%) but for now is only the base of it(talents are disabled).
