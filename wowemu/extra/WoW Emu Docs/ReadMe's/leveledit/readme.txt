        THIS IS NOT A TCL SCRIPT, BUT A TK APPLICATION, DO NOT TRY TO LOAD IT
        ON YOUR SERVER OR YOU WILL CRASH BOTH IT AND YOUR SYSTEM.
        YOU NEED A FULL TCL/TK ENVIRONMENT TO BE ABLE TO RUN THIS PROGRAM IF
        UNCOMPILED.


How to use the Start-TCL Level Editor
=====================================

 1. Execute the file.
 
    That simply it, just run it, it will guide you the rest of the way, by
    asking for your server root folder, reading the current TCL and TBC files,
    sorting them and displaying a screen similar to a file browser.
 
 2. Changing levels.
 
    Either double-click or right-click a file and a level editor dialog will
    appear. Either select a standard level or enter one manually and apply the
    changes. The display will update with your changes.
    
    If you select a folder, all files it contains IN THE CURRENT LEVEL, will be
    changed. Files it may contain in other levels will be untouched.
    
 3. License.
 
    This is GPL, not LGPL, so take care since it's much more restrictive what
    you can do with it.
