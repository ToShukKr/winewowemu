#
# Changelog:
#
# v0.8.0 (2006-03-19) -	The "run it everywhere" version.
#			Finaly got it compiled without errors, ready for
#			distribution.
#
# v0.7.3 (2006-03-19) -	The "give us freedom" version.
#			Got rid of the version dependencies regarding the
#			library needed to access the registry.
#
# v0.7.2 (2006-03-19) -	The "if at first you don't succeed..." version.
#			Fixed the dealing with level headers for good.
#
# v0.7.1 (2006-03-19) -	The "never works the first time" version.
#			I forgot all about when a file still hasn't the level
#			header and it was failing. Thanks spirit for noting it.
#
# v0.7.0 (2006-03-19) -	The "unreachable" version.
#			Added logic to deal with unreacheable folders. It's
#			ready for primetime I think.
#
# v0.6.0 (2006-03-18) -	The "I can't believe that three days went by" version.
#			It's done, I can't say more. The whole heart of the
#			program was done in three days non-stop of trial & error
#			attempts, so I'm a bit off balance with the lack of
#			sleep.
#
# v0.5.0 (2006-03-15) -	The "push my buttons" version.
#			Created several standard buttons and a status line
#			widget system.
#
# v0.4.0 (2006-03-15) -	The "folder search" version.
#			Done creating a basic widget to get the server top
#			folder.
#
# v0.3.1 (2006-03-14) -	The "waiter, oh waiter... menu please" version.
#			Created a basic menu with several standard entries.
#
# v0.3.0 (2006-03-14) -	The "open the window" version.
#			Started to work the root widget to see what can be done
#			with it.
#
# v0.2.0 (2006-03-13) -	The "lets start with what we have" version.
#			Converted some basic procedures from other scripts to
#			run on this standalone version.
#
# v0.1.0 (2006-03-13) -	The "let us see what TK can do" version.
#			First attempt with TK. Setup the basic structure and
#			created some test widgets.
