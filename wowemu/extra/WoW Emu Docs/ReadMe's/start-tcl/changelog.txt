# Changelog:
#
# v0.8.2 (2006-03-20) -	The "sort it out" version.
#			Reverted back to "dictionary" sorting since "integer"
#			chokes on levels that start by 0 and are followed by 8
#			or 9 'cause the option assumes they are octal numbers.
#			Included a graphical level editor to the archive to
#			ease level setting. Included WorldLock.tcl back to the
#			pack, READ the instructions or it WILL crash your
#			system,
#
# v0.8.1 (2006-03-15) -	The "space in space" version.
#			Found out a problem with "concat" when the path
#			contains spaces, converted to "lappend".
#
# v0.8.0 (2006-03-15) -	The "ready for prime time" version.
#			Done the documentation explaining how to set
#			it up.
#
# v0.7.2 (2006-03-11) -	The "faster than a speeding bullet" version.
#			Final changes. One important for performance is that
#			the StartTCL information regarding the level to run at
#			must be in the first block of comments at the top of
#			the script, before any non-comment data (excluding
#			empty lines) or else it will be ignored.
#
# v0.7.1 (2006-03-10) -	The "there can be only one" version.
#			If there are two files with identical names only
#			differing in the extension issue a warning.
#
# v0.7.0 (2006-03-10) -	The "one size fits all" version.
#			All scripts are now loaded from the same folder,
#			regardless of being TCL or TBC.
#
# v0.6.6 (2006-03-08) -	The "lets go global" version.
#			spirit's onboard. It's more than deserved since half
#			the changes are either his suggestions or his code so
#			it's co-authored from now on. Going global for the sort
#			system both TCL and TBC based.
#
# v0.6.5 (2006-03-02) -	The "no dash to separate us" version.
#			Removed the dash "-" from the namespace and script name
#			since it was giving too many trouble.
#
# v0.6.4 (2006-02-28) -	The "less is best" version.
#			Reduced the number of levels by one, since there was no
#			need for 4 start levels.
#
# v0.6.3 (2006-02-26) -	The "new approach" version.
#			OK, I found a weakness by relying only on the filename,
#			so I looked for another approach and BSD systems have
#			it. The file itself contains the information of when it
#			should be loaded, so this is a much more robust method.
#
# v0.6.2 (2006-02-22) -	The "preload bye bye" version.
#			I finaly decided to give up the preloader idea, it was
#			prone to misinterpretations and errors, it's time to go
#			System V all the way, which means that filenames alone
#			decide the order of loading, the rest is decided by
#			convention.
#
# v0.6.1 (2006-02-20) -	The "sort me out" version.
#			Redid the whole idea by case insensitive sorting the
#			filenames, which gives a consistent order across OS
#			versions.
#
# v0.6.0 (2006-02-01) -	The "inform me of errors" version.
#			Included the $errorInfo variable in error messages.
#
# v0.5.0 (2006-01-26) -	The "incremental" version.
#			Changed the way the counters are incremented.
#
# v0.4.0 (2006-01-26) -	The "with license" version.
#			Put it under LGPL, instead of GPL.
#
# v0.3.0 (2006-01-14) -	The "best of both" version.
#			I'm puting back the former behaviour of loading files
#			from the "scripts\pls" into the WoWEmu namespace. To
#			add global directives and/or defines edit/create
#			"scripts/local/preload.tcl".
#
# v0.2.0 (2006-01-14) -	The "better make up your mind" version.
#			I'm still trying to figure out the best way to preload
#			scripts.
#
# v0.1.0 (2006-01-13) -	The "I sure hope I'm doing it right" version.
#			First attempt. This is going to be very generic. I
#			didn't base it in nothing particular, but took ideas
#			from here and there from almost every "startup.tcl" I
#			got my hands on so WDDG, Ecko007, Ramanubis, spirit,
#			GriffonHeart and Golgorth are just the ones that I
#			remember, most surelly there are others.
