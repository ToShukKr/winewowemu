			TO ALL REPACKERS

I've noticed that it's been missing in a repack or two so here goes.

It's part of the terms of the LGPL that it's text be included with programs
licensed under it. It is also my wish that this program is accompanied with it,
so I ask all repackers to please include the "docs/ngauction/lgpl.txt" whenever
you include this plugin in your repack.

Thank you very much, for your compreension.
