Language files installation:

- Copy the tcl files you need (-Texts_<language_code>.tcl) to the tcl directory.
  It is better not to delete -Texts_en.tcl even if you don't use English.
  It will work as a fallback if your language file is missing some texts.

- Open "scripts/scripts.conf" and change the "language" variable.
