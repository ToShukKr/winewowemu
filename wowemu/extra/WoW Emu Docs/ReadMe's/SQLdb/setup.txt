			Setting up the SQLdb TCL library
			================================

 1. Clean install
    -------------

   1. If you have a fairly decent "scripts/startup.tcl" this should have been
      already setup for you, if not open it with a text editor and insert the
      following at the highest point possible of it (idealy it should be the
      very first thing in it, but some global variables before it are OK, since
      they may be used by the loaded libraries):

	foreach dir [ glob -nocomplain -type d lib/* ] {
		source $dir/pkgIndex.tcl
	}

      This may be already there with bell and wistles (like error checking and
      the likes) so if you find those lines or any reference to "pkgIndex.tcl"
      being sourced, you wont be needing it.


   2. Not all scripts will be converted to use SQLdb at once (some may end up
      never being, that's with each author) so you'll have to judge in a case
      by case base and remove loading code and database initializing commands
      that no longer are used (each script that uses SQLdb should have
      instructions on how to clean up from older versions) though note that
      some commands are shared amongst several scripts so only remove when you
      are sure that it's no longer needed by ANY script. Examples are:

	load <some path>/tclsqlite3.dll
	load <some path>/libmysqltcl.dll

      or

	sqlite3 <some handle> "<some path>/<some file>"

      or

	foreach link [info vars "mysql*"] {
		catch { ::mysql::close $link }
	}

      or

	if { [catch { set myqe_db [::mysql::connect -host $mysql(host) -user $mysql(user) -password $mysql(password) -db $mysql(db)] }] } {
		puts "MyQE: MySQL connection error. Exiting..."
		return
	}
	puts "MyQE: Done"

      In short, any reference to a SQL database should be analysed. These can
      be found scatered along your TCL files but the most common are the above
      "scripts/startup.tcl" and "commands.tcl", "buybackmail.tcl", "sql.tcl",
      and/or "mysql.tcl" (all in a subfolder of "scripts", normally "tcl", but
      also "lx" is common). If you are running the start-tcl system forget this
      (it already comes correctly set).


   3. Extract the archive (I guess you already did that if you are reading this
      file) and move the "lib" folder to the base folder of your server (at the
      same level of "WoWemu.exe", you should see one if you see the other).


   4. Move the "scripts/sqldb.conf" to your server's "scripts" folder, and MAKE
      SURE to edit it to reflect your system configuration. It is very well
      commented so, just read it.


   5. Optionally move the "bin" folder to the base folder of your server (it
      has some usefull utilities related to the database engines).


   6. Optionally move the "docs" folder to the base folder of your server (it's
      a good practice keeping documentation at hand).


   7. If your server was running either restart it or as GM issue ".retcl" to
      load the system.


   8. You are done, the rest is with the scripts that will be using SQLdb.


 2. Upgrading
    ---------

   1. Each folder in "lib" is for a different library, so you may upgrade them
      by the pack or one by one. All files distributed with SQLdb have version
      information incorporated (right click, select properties and the version
      tab to access) so you can check which version you have on your system
      (other files may not have such information, so you must, keep track of
      those yourself).


   2. To upgrader a library, simply replace its folder with a new one (make
      SURE that the new folder has an updated "pkgIndex.tcl" file, you CAN NOT
      use the old one without editing it) and do that for all folders for which
      you have an update library.


   3. The libraries the come with SQLdb are (by folder name) "libmysqltcl",
      "oratcl", "pgtclng", "sybtcl", "tclsqlite", "tclsqlite3" (MySQL, Oracle,
      PostgreSQL, Sybase, SQLite and SQLite3), "sqldb" (SQLdb itself) and
      "tbcload" (TBC binary loader).


   4. If your server was running either restart it or as GM issue ".retcl" to
      reload the system.
