2006-03-09 - v4.30

  With the incoming start-tcl system, I'll let users deal with load order.

- "Guard Defense" renamed "Defense System" and now allows both players and npcs to be defended.
  Generator to have a corrected "creatures.scp" for guard defense automatic mode (more information in "readme_defense.txt").

- Reduced the minimum distance when checking for guards already defending players.

2006-03-02 - v4.20

- The changelog is now unified, I will talk about the Honor System, the Warsong Gulch script, the addon
  or anything else included with the release. This has not been just a Honor System for some time already.

- New option "guard_defense" that allows players to ask guards for assistance against mobs or players.
  The default mode works semi-automatic, where players have to click on the guard each time they want assistance.
  An automatic mode is available, but I am a bit concerned about performance.
  You may have to click at least once on the guard each time you load the server or .retcl even in the automatic mode.
  Make sure your maps are correctly extracted.
  The addon SpiritHonor v1.20 is needed.

- The resurrection spell of Spirit Guides has been changed to the one suggested by deathkiller.
  Hopefully it will work with friendly faction (35), if you want them to be friendly at any case.

- This was already done, but I forgot to mention that the players from the losing team at Warsong Gulch
  get 1 piece of reward if the match lasted more than 10 minutes. The winners always get 3 pieces.

- Fixed a bug reported by DeadMan that affected honor when killing guards.

- Updated Portuguese translation thanks to ItizaI.

- Fixed maxhealth/damage/combat_reach for Honor NPCs thanks to ZORG.

- Text files have been moved to a seperate directory and are loaded by the Texts script, which is in -Custom.tcl.
  Also those files can now be encoded in UTF-8 with BOM.
