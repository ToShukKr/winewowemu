				TO ALL REPACKERS

It's part of the terms of the LGPL as well as the GFDL that their texts be
included with programs or documents licensed under them, so I ask repackers to
please include the "docs/lgpl.txt" and "docs/fdl.txt" whenever you include this
script and its documentation in your repack.

Thank you very much, for your compreension.
