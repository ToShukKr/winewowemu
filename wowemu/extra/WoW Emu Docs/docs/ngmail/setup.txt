        VERY IMPORTANT: If you ever rename the NextGen Mail System file
        from the default "ngMail.tcl" you MUST make sure that it is
        loaded after the "Commands.tcl", or else you will render your
        server useless.


How to install the NextGen Mail System
===============================================

 0. Remove any other version you might have of the Mail System, namelly
    Golgorth's Final Mail or the Rivera Mail server scripts by OXOTHuK:

    0. If you are running the StartTCL Startup System, you most sure don't have
       any other version of the Mail System, so you may skip this whole step.

    1. Locate the "commands.tcl" file under your scripts folder (it can be in
       "tcl" or "lx" depending on which repack you have).

    2. Open it with a text browser (i.e. Notepad) and locate and remove any
       and all of:

       "try" { return [Commands::try $player $cargs $args] }
       "create_maildb" { return [Commands::create_maildb $player $cargs] }
       "maildo_send" { return [Commands::maildo_send $player $cargs] }
       "maildo_delete" { return [Commands::maildo_delete $player $cargs] }
       "maildo_get" { return [Commands::maildo_get $player $cargs] }
       "maildo_newmails" { return [Commands::maildo_newmails $player $cargs] }
       "maildo_getmoney" { return [Commands::maildo_getmoney $player $cargs] }
       "maildo_getitem" { return [Commands::maildo_getitem $player $cargs] }

    3. If this was the only plugin accessing your underlying database or if all
       other you have on your system are already using the SQLdb library,
       locate the "startup.tcl" file in your scripts folder, open it with a
       text browser (i.e. Notepad) and locate and remove:

       set pl [package names]
       if { [lsearch $pl "mysqltcl"]==-1 } {
           puts "MyQE: mysqltcl extension not found. Exiting..."
           return
           }
       unset pl

       puts "MyQE: Opening MySQL connection..."
       package require mysqltcl

       foreach link [info vars "mysql*"] {
           catch { ::mysql::close $link }
           }

       if { [catch { set myqe_db [::mysql::connect -host $mysql(host) -user $mysql(user) -password $mysql(password) -db $mysql(db)] }] } {
           puts "MyQE: MySQL connection error. Exiting..."
           return
           }
       puts "MyQE: Done"

    4. Again if this was the only plugin accessing your underlying database or
       if all other you have on your system are already using the SQLdb
       library, in the same file locate and remove:

       # MySQL Settings ##############################################################
       set mysql(host) "mysql_host"
       set mysql(user) "db_user"
       set mysql(password) "db_password"
       set mysql(db) "you_data_base_name"
       # MySQL Settings ##############################################################

    5. Still in the same file locate and remove:

       load tbcload14.dll

    6. Locate and remove the "mail.tbc" file from your system (depending on
       which repack you have, it can be in "scripts/compiled", "scripts/tcl",
       "scripts/lx" or "scripts/tbc").

    7. Locate and remove the "Mailsys.tcl" file from your system (depending
       on which repack you have, it can be in "scripts/tcl" or "scripts/lx").

 1. Download the SQLdb middleware library and follow its instructions for
    installation:

    1. Download it from <http://catvir.mooo.com/viewtopic.php?t=677>

    2. Extract it to a temporary folder, and copy the "lib" folder to your
       server top folder (it must be at the same level as Wowemu.exe so, if you
       see one you should see the other) and make sure you overwrite existing
       files since the included are the latest ones available.

    3. Locate the "startup.tcl" file in your scripts folder, open it with a
       text browser (i.e. Notepad) and:

       0. If you are running the StartTCL Startup System skip to step 1.4.

       1. Locate the string "foreach script [glob scripts/tcl/*.tcl] {" (if you
          are using the UWC-RR it's "foreach script [glob scripts/lx/*.tcl] {")
          and add BEFORE it (if you have a fairly decent script it might
          already be there):

          foreach dir [ glob -nocomplain -type d lib/* ] {
	      source $dir/pkgIndex.tcl
          }

       2. Locate the same string "foreach script [glob scripts/tcl/*.tcl] {"
          (again for UWC-RR it's "foreach script [glob scripts/lx/*.tcl] {")
          and now add AFTER it (if you have a fairly decent script it might
          already be there, also note that the path "scripts/tbc" may differ
          from the location where your repack puts compiled scripts, so change
          accordingly):

          foreach script [glob -nocomplain scripts/tbc/*.tbc] { 
              if {$DEBUG == 1} {source $script} 
              if {[catch {source $script}]} {set err "$err\n Can't load script \[$script\]"} 
          }

   4. Move the "scripts/conf/sqldb.conf" to your server's "scripts/conf"
      folder, and MAKE SURE to edit it to reflect your system configuration
      (you may find the values that you need to put there in variables in your
      "startup.tcl"). The "scripts/conf/sqldb.conf" is very well commented so,
      just read it.

   5. That's basically it, if you want more info regarding installing SQLdb,
      have a look at "docs/sqldb/setup.txt" that comes with the library.

 2. Extract the NextGen Mail System version to a temporary folder and:

    1. Change to the "scripts" folder inside the temporary folder and copy one,
       AND ONLY ONE, of the contents of either the "tbc" or "tcl" folders to
       the correct location on your server (the content of the "tcl" folder may
       go to one of "scripts/tcl" or "scripts/lx" depending on which repack you
       have, the content of the "tbc" folder may go to one of "scripts/tbc",
       "scripts/compiled", "scripts/tcl" or "scripts/lx" depending on which
       repack you have or how you have setup the above 1.3.2 step).

    2. Which script to choose:

       a. If you aren't a developer, you're satisfied in using the default
          configuration, or your system is configured to mostly support
          compiled scripts you can use the compiled script from the "tbc"
          folder.

       b. If you want to be able to edit the file, you don't have support for
          compiled scripts or you simply prefer to use uncompiled scripts you
          can use the script from the "tcl" folder.

       Note: There is NO user configuration made inside the "ngMail.tcl", so
             whatever the file you choose it is universal.

    3. Edit your "scripts/emu.conf" (if you are using the UWC-RR edit instead
       "scripts/extra/addons.conf") and add or modify it to read:

       [client_addon Rivera_Mail]
       enabled=1
       crc=00F5A011D
       pub=86U7NkccLccCdz6muYAV51IcoayAZ6GIW6N3YjvOr0ejiec6tBRbnkHttvXFu6ZHO9jgQEqMJ0T7MgFmp51bNMpn4ejXInrDqXuQlg6IGO5DGLeb6C/TY19vVr24BLSFLArMRmRbEq9JRTneCQBIpusqP0ixW+56PkcZzkCWw1pHvH2M0CdeRhg+HvWpcKVUKTxa/3ag43Ud+pTX9UEenYSculiy/kwdbs4OL3gPvvhr/vKIrSjn8ZfjP1EZ6MmGN4S9UZR7hhl1F9RxHiQGY0Erq/sfITu44OT7NSw/DmNqMvXBnXWLvfNAskzU8UhDsGqcgcucCBA8kRxhniXH7Q==

    4. Add (or modify) the entries for Chronos and myAddOns with the following
       (these are the latest as of this writting with all signatures generated
       by me):

       [client_addon Chronos]
       enabled=1
       crc=00F5A011D
       pub=86U7NkccLccCdz6muYAV51IcoayAZ6GIW6N3YjvOr0ejiec6tBRbnkHttvXFu6ZHO9jgQEqMJ0T7MgFmp51bNMpn4ejXInrDqXuQlg6IGO5DGLeb6C/TY19vVr24BLSFLArMRmRbEq9JRTneCQBIpusqP0ixW+56PkcZzkCWw1pHvH2M0CdeRhg+HvWpcKVUKTxa/3ag43Ud+pTX9UEenYSculiy/kwdbs4OL3gPvvhr/vKIrSjn8ZfjP1EZ6MmGN4S9UZR7hhl1F9RxHiQGY0Erq/sfITu44OT7NSw/DmNqMvXBnXWLvfNAskzU8UhDsGqcgcucCBA8kRxhniXH7Q==

       [client_addon myAddOns]
       enabled=1
       crc=00F5A011D
       pub=86U7NkccLccCdz6muYAV51IcoayAZ6GIW6N3YjvOr0ejiec6tBRbnkHttvXFu6ZHO9jgQEqMJ0T7MgFmp51bNMpn4ejXInrDqXuQlg6IGO5DGLeb6C/TY19vVr24BLSFLArMRmRbEq9JRTneCQBIpusqP0ixW+56PkcZzkCWw1pHvH2M0CdeRhg+HvWpcKVUKTxa/3ag43Ud+pTX9UEenYSculiy/kwdbs4OL3gPvvhr/vKIrSjn8ZfjP1EZ6MmGN4S9UZR7hhl1F9RxHiQGY0Erq/sfITu44OT7NSw/DmNqMvXBnXWLvfNAskzU8UhDsGqcgcucCBA8kRxhniXH7Q==

 3. If you are running the StartTCL system forget all of the above and simply
    drop the content of either "scripts/tbc" or "scripts/tcl" in your server's
    "scripts/tcl" folder.

 4. Restart your server (either shutting it down and bringing it back up, or
    using the ".retcl" command).

 5. Make your players extract the contents of "ngMail_Client_Addon_1.0.4.7z"
    to the WoW Interface folder, "%ProgramFiles%\World of Warcraft\Interface",
    and make them be sure to extract the paths from the archive.
