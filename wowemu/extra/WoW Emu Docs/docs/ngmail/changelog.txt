# Author:	Lazarus Long <lazarus.long@bigfoot.com>
#
# Changelog:
#
# v0.9.0 (2006-03-28) -	The "no more identification" version.
#			Fixed the dealing with activating DEBUG on the config
#			file. Converted it to use ReadConf from Custom, and
#			Provide and Requires from StartTCL. Receive the item ID
#			instad of its name from the client, due to this, this
#			version is incompatible with client versions prior to
#			1.1.0.
#
# v0.8.3 (2006-03-01) -	The "start-tcl integration" version.
#			Added the needed options to support the new start-tcl
#			scheme, also moved the "scripts/ngmail.conf" to the new
#			"scripts/conf" folder. Changed SQL queries to be case
#			insensitive for player names, thanks to XuTMaH.
#
# v0.8.2 (2006-02-23) -	The "by your command" version.
#			Fixed command processing when spirit's "AddCommand"
#			isn't present/used.
#
# v0.8.1 (2006-02-22) -	The "lets go international" version.
#			Added localization for German by Ramanubis (verified by
#			ZeberRus), Chilian Spanish by EZ-Mouse, Standard
#			Spanish by ZeberRus, French by spirit and Russian by
#			Neo_mat. Thank you all.
#
# v0.8.0 (2006-02-20) -	The "you got mail" version.
#			Tested with both client addons, an it seems to work
#			(of course that with Rivera Mail, the new functions
#			don't, duhhh). Added localization support with the
#			file "scripts/ngmail.conf" and setup the auto init
#			procedures. First public beta.
#
# v0.7.8 (2006-02-19) -	The "use existing facilities" version.
#			Converted the script to use spirit's custom procedures
#			"::Custom::AddCommand" and "::Custom::HookProc" if
#			present (I hope I did it correctly, I'm not sure of the
#			second one). (development version)
#
# v0.7.7 (2006-02-17) -	The "wherever it comes from we deliver" version.
#			Added startup dealing with importing MySQL tables.
#			(development version)
#
# v0.7.6 (2006-02-17) -	The "return to sender" version.
#			Implemented a return to sender option for CoD mails.
#			(development version)
#
# v0.7.5 (2006-02-16) -	The "handle it to spirit" version.
#			Corrected the dealing with the database handle due to a
#			wrong interpretation of the variable linking concept,
#			after spirit called my attention to it. Thank you
#			spirit. (development version)
#
# v0.7.4 (2006-02-14) -	The "charge on delivery revisited" version.
#			Fixed the CoD dealing, now it's Blizz-like, it sends a
#			mail message instead of crediting directly the player.
#			Droped the procedures "cod" and "itosmoney" (pity, this
#			second one was very slick). Once again redid the
#			database format to allow Auction House Invoices in a
#			Blizzard fashion, This implies that I'll have to change
#			"SendMail" once more.  (development version)
#
# v0.7.3 (2006-02-13) -	The "postman changed but mail arrived" version.
#			Created routines to import mail from the existing
#			Golgorth's Final Mail tables (it supports both existing
#			formats, with and without "time_send"). (development
#			version)
#
# v0.7.2 (2006-02-13) -	The "read it once" version.
#			Implemented the timing out of mail in a Blizz-like
#			fashion. The CoD dealing isn't yet Blizz-like, so it
#			still needs to be worked. This gave origin to a new
#			server command "read". (development version)
#
# v0.7.1 (2006-02-12) -	The "back step by step" version.
#			Removed the multipage code from the "get" procedure,
#			since the plugin seems to deal with it. (development
#			version)
#
# v0.7.0 (2006-02-12) -	The "who am I?" version.
#			Created the "serverinfo" procedure and changed the
#			"get" procedure to allow multiple pages to function.
#			(development version)
#
# v0.6.0 (2006-02-11) -	The "slim me down" version.
#			Changed the database format to a slimmer one, had to
#			redo all procedures related. (development version)
#
# v0.5.0 (2006-02-10) -	The "dressed for reharsall" version.
#			OK, I had to redo the date logic to make it acceptable,
#			so "get" and "send" had to be worked. First full script
#			version. (development version)
#
# v0.4.1 (2006-02-09) -	The "keep them sending" version.
#			"send" and "delete" are ready to go. (development
#			version)
#
# v0.4.0 (2006-02-09) -	The "cash and carry" version.
#			"get", "getitem" and "getmoney" are in place.
#			(development version)
#
# v0.3.0 (2006-02-08) -	The "charge on delivery" version.
#			Split the CoD logic to make it easier to check and
#			maintain. (development version)
#
# v0.2.0 (2006-02-08) -	The "fetch Ubu fetch" version.
#			"newmails" is working (I got to see the client about
#			that damn icon). (development version)
#
# v0.1.0 (2006-02-08) -	The "where do we start at?" version.
#			Created the basic layout of the file and started to
#			analyse the Rivera Mail client addon to see what makes
#			it tick. (development version)
