        VERY IMPORTANT: If you ever rename the NextGen Auction House
        System file from the default "ngAuction.tcl" you MUST make sure
        that it is loaded after both of your Agro System procedures and
        the "Commands.tcl", or else you will render your server useless.


How to install the NextGen Auction House System
===============================================

 0. Remove any other version you might have of the Auction House System,
    namelly the compiled version for MySQL by OXOTHuK:
    
    0. If you are running the StartTCL Startup System, you most sure don't have
       any other version of the Auction House System, so you may skip this
       whole step.

    1. Locate the "commands.tcl" file under your scripts folder (it can be in
       "tcl" or "lx" depending on which repack you have).

    2. Open it with a text browser (i.e. Notepad) and locate and remove:

       "auc" { return [Auction::work $player $cargs $args] }
       "aucf" { return [Auction::auc_force $player 0] }
       "aucq" { return [Auction::auc_force $player 1] }
       "auct" { return [Auction::auc_trade $player $full] }

    3. If this was the only plugin accessing your underlying database or if all
       other you have on your system are already using the SQLdb library,
       locate the "startup.tcl" file in your scripts folder, open it with a
       text browser (i.e. Notepad) and locate and remove:

       set pl [package names]
       if { [lsearch $pl "mysqltcl"]==-1 } {
           puts "MyQE: mysqltcl extension not found. Exiting..."
           return
           }
       unset pl

       puts "MyQE: Opening MySQL connection..."
       package require mysqltcl

       foreach link [info vars "mysql*"] {
           catch { ::mysql::close $link }
           }

       if { [catch { set myqe_db [::mysql::connect -host $mysql(host) -user $mysql(user) -password $mysql(password) -db $mysql(db)] }] } {
           puts "MyQE: MySQL connection error. Exiting..."
           return
           }
       puts "MyQE: Done"

    4. Again if this was the only plugin accessing your underlying database or
       if all other you have on your system are already using the SQLdb
       library, in the same file locate and remove:

       # MySQL Settings ##############################################################
       set mysql(host) "mysql_host"
       set mysql(user) "db_user"
       set mysql(password) "db_password"
       set mysql(db) "you_data_base_name"
       # MySQL Settings ##############################################################

    5. Still in the same file locate and remove:

       load tbcload14.dll

    6. Locate and remove the "auction.tbc" file from your system (depending on
       which repack you have, it can be in "scripts/compiled", "scripts/tcl",
       "scripts/lx" or "scripts/tbc").

    7. Locate and remove the "SQliteAuction.tcl" file from your system
       (depending on which repack you have, it can be in "scripts/tcl"  or
       "scripts/lx").

    8. Locate and remove the "SQLiteAuction.tbc" file from your system
       (depending on which repack you have, it can be in "scripts/compiled",
       "scripts/tcl", "scripts/lx" or "scripts/tbc").

 1. Download the SQLdb middleware library and follow its instructions for
    installation:

    1. Download it from <http://catvir.mooo.com/viewtopic.php?t=677>

    2. Extract it to a temporary folder, and copy the "lib" folder to your
       server top folder (it must be at the same level as Wowemu.exe so, if you
       see one you should see the other) and make sure you overwrite existing
       files since the included are the latest ones available.

    3. Locate the "startup.tcl" file in your scripts folder, open it with a
       text browser (i.e. Notepad) and:
       
       0. If you are running the StartTCL Startup System skip to step 1.4.

       1. Locate the string "foreach script [glob scripts/tcl/*.tcl] {" (if you
          are using the UWC-RR it's "foreach script [glob scripts/lx/*.tcl] {")
          and add BEFORE it (if you have a fairly decent script it might
          already be there):

          foreach dir [ glob -nocomplain -type d lib/* ] {
              source $dir/pkgIndex.tcl
          }

       2. Locate the same string "foreach script [glob scripts/tcl/*.tcl] {"
          (again for UWC-RR it's "foreach script [glob scripts/lx/*.tcl] {")
          and now add AFTER it (if you have a fairly decent script it might
          already be there, also note that the path "scripts/tbc" may differ
          from the location where your repack puts compiled scripts, so change
          accordingly):

          foreach script [glob -nocomplain scripts/tbc/*.tbc] { 
              if {$DEBUG == 1} {source $script} 
              if {[catch {source $script}]} {set err "$err\n Can't load script \[$script\]"} 
          }

   4. Move the "scripts/conf/sqldb.conf" to your server's "scripts/conf"
      folder, and MAKE SURE to edit it to reflect your system configuration
      (you may find the values that you need to put there in variables in your
      "startup.tcl"). The "scripts/conf/sqldb.conf" is very well commented so,
      just read it.

    5. That's basically it, if you want more info regarding installing SQLdb,
       have a look at "docs/sqldb/setup.txt" that comes with the library.

 2. Extract the NextGen Auction House System version to a temporary folder and:

    1. Change to the "scripts" folder inside the temporary folder and copy one,
       AND ONLY ONE, of the contents of either the "tbc" or "tcl" folders to
       the correct location on your server (the content of the "tcl" folder may
       go to one of "scripts/tcl" or "scripts/lx" depending on which repack you
       have, the content of the "tbc" folder may go to one of "scripts/tbc",
       "scripts/compiled", "scripts/tcl" or "scripts/lx" depending on which
       repack you have or how you have setup the above 1.3.2 step).

    2. Which script to choose:

       a. If you aren't a developer, you're satisfied in using the default
          configuration, or your system is configured to mostly support
          compiled scripts you can use the compiled script from the "tbc"
          folder.

       b. If you want to be able to edit the file, you don't have support for
          compiled scripts or you simply prefer to use uncompiled scripts you
          can use the script from the "tcl" folder.

       Note: There is NO user configuration made inside the "ngAuction.tcl"
             anymore, so whatever the file you choose it is universal.

    3. Edit your "scripts/emu.conf" (if you are using the UWC-RR edit instead
       "scripts/extra/addons.conf") and add to it (if it's not there already):

       [client_addon Rivera_Auction]
       enabled=1
       crc=00F5A011D
       pub=86U7NkccLccCdz6muYAV51IcoayAZ6GIW6N3YjvOr0ejiec6tBRbnkHttvXFu6ZHO9jgQEqMJ0T7MgFmp51bNMpn4ejXInrDqXuQlg6IGO5DGLeb6C/TY19vVr24BLSFLArMRmRbEq9JRTneCQBIpusqP0ixW+56PkcZzkCWw1pHvH2M0CdeRhg+HvWpcKVUKTxa/3ag43Ud+pTX9UEenYSculiy/kwdbs4OL3gPvvhr/vKIrSjn8ZfjP1EZ6MmGN4S9UZR7hhl1F9RxHiQGY0Erq/sfITu44OT7NSw/DmNqMvXBnXWLvfNAskzU8UhDsGqcgcucCBA8kRxhniXH7Q==

 3. Make sure you have the server-side mail system up and running:

    1. If you are running the NextGen Mail System it's already setup correctly.

    2. If you are running another mail system, make sure the server-side
       scripts for the Rivera Mail System (either by OXOThuk or by Golgorth)
       are installed and running.

       Note: When running the server-side scripts for Rivera Mail System both
             SQL tables must be in the same database. This is already true for
             most, if not all, those who use MySQL, but for SQLite, this might
             not be true, so locate the database handle initialization for the
             "mail" table "sqlite3 mail <some path>" and edit the config file
             "scripts/conf/sqldb.conf" to point to the same location.

 4. If you are running the StartTCL system forget all of the above and simply
    drop the content of either "scripts/tbc" or "scripts/tcl" in your server's
    "scripts/tcl" folder.

 5. Restart your server (either shutting it down and bringing it back up, or
    using the ".retcl" command).

 6. Make your players extract the contents of "client/rivera_auction_0.4.2.7z"
    to the WoW Interface folder, "%ProgramFiles%\World of Warcraft\Interface",
    and make them be sure to extract the paths from the archive.
