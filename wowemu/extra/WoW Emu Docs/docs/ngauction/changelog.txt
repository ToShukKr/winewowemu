#
# Changelog:
#
# v1.0.1 (2006-03-28) -	The "minor adjustments" version.
#			I need a new brain. Damn stupid little things made me
#			make a new version. Corrected minor glitches.
#
# v1.0.0 (2006-03-28) -	The "at last we made it" version.
#			Fixed the dealing with activating DEBUG on the config
#			file. Removed the 5 second fuziness when calling the
#			"process" procedure when it is hooked to the procedure
#			"::WoWEmu::Commands". Converted it to use ReadConf from
#			Custom, and Provide and Requires from StartTCL. Added
#			Spanish Standard translation thanks to JOS3. Updated
#			the client addon to avoid the ".auct" bug and added
#			public key signature.
#
# v0.9.9 (2006-03-02) -	The "server friendly" version.
#			As sugested by spirit, moved the hooked function from
#			"::AI::CanUnAgro" to "::WoWEmu::Commands" since it's
#			less heavy on the server and the auction timeout isn't
#			a crucial to the part-of-a-second thing. Added Chilian
#			Spanish translation thanks to EZ-Mouse. Added support
#			for the new StartTCL scheme of loading files.
#
# v0.9.8 (2006-02-20) -	The "who is missing" version.
#			To make the Auction Invoices as Blizz-like as possible
#			I needed to pass along the buyer or seller of the item,
#			hence new (and final) change to "SendMail". Updated
#			again the Russian translation.
#
# v0.9.7 (2006-02-19) -	The "to invoice or not to invoice" version.
#			Redid the "SendMail" procedure to issue Blizzard
#			compatible invoices when connected to ngMail, adapted
#			existing calls to it. Added French translation, thanks
#			to spirit. Added German translation, thanks to
#			Ramanubis. Converted the script to use spirit's custom
#			procedures "::Custom::AddCommand" and
#			"::Custom::HookProc" if present (I hope I did it
#			correctly, I'm not sure of the second one).
#
# v0.9.6 (2006-02-17) -	The "handle it to spirit" version.
#			Corrected the dealing with the database handle due to a
#			wrong interpretation of the variable linking concept,
#			after spirit called my attention to it. Thank you
#			spirit. Corrected a stupid error I introduced in last
#			version, thanks Vasya for reporting and spirit for
#			correcting. Added Russian translation, thanks to
#			Neo_mat for the work. Corrected an error I made in the
#			"readConf" procedure that whould read the config file
#			to the end even if it was already loaded the chosen
#			language.
#
# v0.9.5 (2006-02-13) -	The "let's go international" version.
#			Added the first translation, Hungarian, thanks to
#			merkantizis for the work. Renamed some functions for
#			clarity. Moved the handle to the SQLdb namespace to
#			prepare for multiple plugins using it. Simplified the
#			SQL statements when doing a update. Modified the
#			"readConf" procedure to allow global definitions.
#			Prepared the "SendMail" procedure to work both with
#			Golgorth's Final Mail 1.0 and ngMail.
#
# v0.9.4 (2006-02-08) -	The "check and double check, please..." version.
#			Found a non standard SQL statement in the proc
#			"create_auctiondb" which crashed the plugin for MySQL
#			users when performing an upgrade from a previous
#			version (nobody complained because there was no
#			previous version to compare to). Also created some
#			aliases for commands all starting with ".auction",
#			use ".auction help" for a list.
#
# v0.9.3 (2006-02-07) -	The "babelfish? what babelfish?" version.
#			OK localization is done. A new file with localization
#			strings is part of the plugin "scripts/ngauction.conf".
#			I'm finished! The development cycle for the plugin is
#			near it's end, I'm reserving the remaining revision
#			numbers for unexpected bugs and addition of languages
#			to the pack (I would like Spanish, French and German at
#			least, others are more than welcome), I hope to get to
#			v1.0.0 in a very short time.
#
# v0.9.2 (2006-02-07) -	The "against the rules" version.
#			Well I decided, against my own rules to turn public one
#			of the development versions. I need some more beta
#			testers and since only poor Neos offered you are all
#			going to be forced volunteers. This will fail, it will
#			render your system useless and it won't work. So please
#			stick with the 0.8.x versions.
#
# v0.9.1 (2006-02-06) -	The "hands off" version.
#			Re-made great part of the startup sequence, so now it's
#			not necessary to do anything at all to get the database
#			up and running, it will be detected if it's a first run,
#			an update or a normal run and it will be acted as
#			accordingly. What was disabled, for now was the mail
#			table bug check, since it was giving too many problems.
#
# v0.8.2 (2006-02-05) -	The "time to timeout" version.
#			Removed the timing out setting on the mail database in
#			hope that problems with UWC-RR get solved, but I'm not
#			sure if that's the cause of them. Also updated the
#			CREATE and DROP syntax, and lost the INDEX (it wasn't
#			used anyway). Already existing databases can be updated
#			with ".create_auctiondb update".
#
# v0.8.1 (2006-02-04) -	The "bug hunting we will go..." version.
#			Caught it! I thought it was in the "makebid" procedure
#			but it was in the "process", hence I couldn't find it
#			before. No more stale entries cluttering the tables.
#
# v0.9.0 (2006-02-03) -	The "next generation" version.
#			Converted the script to use the SQLdb facility. Renamed
#			the script from "SQLiteAuction.tcl" to the new name.
#
# v0.8.0 (2006-01-30) -	The "a beast of its own" version.
#			OK, a new beast has born. There are so many changes
#			that I can't remember them all. For starters read all
#			the previous 0.7.x entries to get a grip of things.
#			Other than that I worked a lot the startup sequence and
#			now you have a script which you just drop in your
#			"scripts/tcl" folder (or whatever you call it) and
#			forget about. No configuration, no setting up database,
#			no initializing, no nothing. The "time_send" column in
#			the mail table is automatically created if it
#			doesn't exist, the auction_* tables are created at
#			startup if they don't exist, they are updated, if
#			needed, several speed parameters are set and a
#			integrity check is performed to the database as a whole
#			(another advantage in having all tables in the same
#			database). I don't remember what else, except that the
#			database handle was changed from "auction" to "db3" for
#			future integration both with other plugins and
#			tcl-start (but you don't need to worry with this unless
#			you are a repacker). Oh, and don't forget that the
#			client addon MUST be upgraded.
#
# v0.7.5 (2006-01-29) -	The "almost there" version.
#			All procedures adapted and working! Just have to figure
#			out several return codes, since this new version only
#			has two: AUC_OK and AUC_ERROR, while the other had a
#			bunch of them.
#
# v0.7.4 (2006-01-29) -	The "the bid bid bid bid bid - part 3" version.
#			The logic of the "makebid" procedure keeps defying me.
#			OK, this time I got it finally right, and working with
#			version 0.4.1 (0.4 with my changes) of the client
#			addon.
#
# v0.7.3 (2006-01-29) -	The "cut, cut, cut" version.
#			I'm deleting the "listitems" procedure and it's call
#			from the "work" procedure. For what I can understand it
#			became unnecessary since its functionality was
#			incorporated in the "searchitems" procedure, and I was
#			unable to make the client addon request for it, so here
#			goes...
#
# v0.6.2 (2006-01-29) -	The "one seconds, two second" version.
#			Corrected a small typo in the "SendMail" procedure,
#			thanks to Stiga for pointing it out.
#
# v0.7.2 (2006-01-29) -	The "the only LUA I know is the Moon" version.
#			Got both "createauction" and "owneritems" procedures
#			working. The number of displayed items per page is 8
#			for the "Auctions" and 7 for "Browse" windows, but the
#			client addon assumed 7 for both, so I had to edit the
#			client addon (I don't know shit about LUA so this was
#			gut feeling plain and simple, I'm not sure of it). I
#			believe that my changes didn't break compatibility with
#			other versions, since I think that they will also have
#			a better fit with them, but I'm not sure.
#
# v0.7.1 (2006-01-29) -	The "oh, shit it's working!" version.
#			I got it working for the "searchitems" procedure,
#			except for the "usable" option, which I still don't
#			know what it does. It now has multiple pages and it can
#			be ordered by a bunch of different ways. I don't know
#			shit about LUA, so it's harder, but I think I got the
#			hang of it.
#
# v0.6.1 (2006-01-29) -	The "missing version" version.
#			Forgot to finish the version querying for the procedure
#			"create_auctiondb" and also parsed the string passed to
#			it in case independent form.
#
# v0.7.0 (2006-01-29) -	The "I don't know what I'm doing" version.
#			Got access to version 0.4 of the client plugin and I'm
#			trying to figure out what are the new fields. (internal
#			version. All 0.7.x will be so for me to make it work,
#			if I ever get it working it'll come out as 0.8.0)
#
# v0.6.0 (2006-01-28) -	The "I'm a moron" version.
#			Damn I am a moron. The "GetItemCategory" procedure was
#			bugged by mixing string and integer returns. Also I
#			introduced a early verification against the "items.scp"
#			database and also kept the previous way of checking the
#			database and they were coliding with each other. Fixed,
#			but it may fail in some strange way still, 'cause I'm
#			not yet at ease with that procedure.
#
# v0.5.4 (2006-01-28) -	The "GM friendly" version.
#			Changed the "create_auctiondb" procedure to spit a help
#			screen with the several new options to it, accessed by
#			using ".create_auctiondb help". Also added version info
#			to the script by creating a "version" procedure,
#			accessed by typing ".version_auction" ingame.
#			(internal version)
#
# v0.5.3 (2006-01-28) -	The "revisited the bid bid bid bid bid" version.
#			Changed the "makebid" and "bideritems" procedures to
#			only delete the current player previous bids allowing
#			other players to see their biddings in the "Bid" window
#			of the client plugin. (internal version)
#
# v0.5.2 (2006-01-28) -	The "let's cleanup when accessing" version.
#			Added a call to "process" procedure in the "work" one
#			in case you are running a pacific server where the Agro
#			system is less used (I'm still evaluating the impact of
#			this, so it might change back).
#
# v0.5.1 (2006-01-27) -	The "bid bid bid bid bid" version.
#			Had wrong logic in the "makebid" procedure, corrected
#			it to the fact that the first bidder wasn't taken in
#			account. (internal version)
#
# v0.5.0 (2006-01-27) -	The "let's keep it tight" version.
#			Setup the system to automatically make the changes to
#			"::WoWEmu:Commands", without having to edit the
#			procedure by hand. Ready for beta testing.
#
# v0.4.0 (2006-01-26) -	The "timing, it's all about timing" version.
#			Setup the database initialization and the check for the
#			required SQLite DLL at system startup. Also setup the
#			system to run "process" procedure at system startup and
#			periodically under the Agro system. (internal version)
#
# v0.3.0 (2006-01-26) -	The "shit, I hope I don't make it worse" version.
#			Double checked the conversion of all MySQL access calls
#			to the corresponding SQLite ones, then proceeded to
#			check/test/fix the procedures one by one to make them
#			work, finally moved all the mail code to a separate
#			procedure for both optimization and possibility to
#			allow using other mail systems in the future. The
#			"GetItemCategory" procedure is the part of the code I
#			understood worse and most sure will need to be checked
#			and fixed. I still have the gut feeling that part of
#			the code is missing, but this is what we have to work
#			with. (internal version)
#
# v0.2.0 (2006-01-24) -	The "it has to be their fault" version.
#			Started to optimize several function calls and
#			corrected some small typos in the code, since the
#			previous version didn't work. (internal version)
#
# v0.1.0 (2006-01-23) -	The "it's gonna be too easy" version.
#			Converted all MySQL access calls to the corresponding
#			SQLite ones. (internal version)
