Release 08.04.06

Almost blizzlikes creatures based on NuRRi's Creatures edited by UWCCT - <n3v> <Reaper> <Raverra> <Malish> <Jack_Siberia> <hedroks> <Cfaniak> <Boujii> - for future versions. Thanks to NuRRi for her almost complete creatures, OutLaw & The Ahn'Qiraj Project for 1.9.x creatures and models, Rama for organising the entire thing, and ST3VO for having me on his site. Big thanks to greenseed who developed that brilliant mdw scp tool, and last but not least Dallas Cantle for being the ever supportive admin of de'VoL and more.

++Admin of Illusionz Realm the server I spent hours on as dwarf hunter Earthstrike decided to wipe for no good reason...I pulled away to another server and began working on my own creatures because he was too stubborn to listen to people's complaints

3.01.06
++"For anyone who has had experience playing on bl!zz4rd servers and realised a major difference in the amount of time it took to kill a creep, this is probably why; according to the GW (Goblin Workshop) database a Level 20 Rabid Dire Wolf has approximately 470 hp. However a Level 20 Rabid Dire Wolf on our servers has 804 hp. Hmmmmmmmm..."
