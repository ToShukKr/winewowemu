DBC Tool v2.7b by TRX.


Q.How to use talents editor?
A. Run my tool, go to Tools/Talent Editor

New widow will appear... up u can change classes and down u can change talent tabs...

Talents are in x,y order like in game so u dont have to worry where u will put ur talents... just use the spot in program and in that spot talent will appear in game...

For each talent u can specify :

--Talent ID (its NOT a spell! just talent id...) i would recommend if u are gonna make new talents, to use nubmers from 1700 and up... but dont ever use numbers like 99999 just start from 1700 and do up one by one...

--Req. Talent...This is where u specify wich talent is needed for this talent to learn...

--Req. N...This is where u specify how much talent points in req. talent is needed for this one to be learned... use from 1 to 5....

-Button S...New window appears where u set talent spells (Rank1, Rank2,....)

-Button OK will apply changes

ATTENTION : Allways edit only one talent at one time, then apply changes, and then u can edit other....


Also, if u want to make new tab, go to empty tab, and first thing u do is specify its NAME...

IF you made NEW talent tab, you also need to make background for it... U got 4 .png files with my program, if u want u can edit them with photoshop...and convert them with BLPConverer to .blp

important is to RENAME them...how? well if your tab's name is "TRX", and its class warlock then filenames would be :

WarlockTRX-BottomLeft.blp
WarlockTRX-BottomRight.blp
WarlockTRX-TopLeft.blp
WarlockTRX-TopRight.blp

when u did that, copy them to : ur "World of Warcraft\Data\Interface\TalentFrame\"(case sensitive!)

and thats all... :D
