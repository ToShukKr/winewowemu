SCP-RefChecker
--------------

Check .scp files for referential integrity.

What does this mean?

If you for example specififed a loot-template entry,
then you must make sure that the item also exists in items.scp.

This little tools will check this for you.

Just copy it to your wowemu dir (NOT inside "scripts")
and start it.
