Check SCP files for referential integrity

eg:
You specified item references in loottemplate.scp

loot=12345 50.0

-> The refChecker will look inside items.scp (and all files included from items.scp)
   and check if an item with the id "12345" exists.
   
Please take a look at "refCheck.conf".
It contains rules, that can be enhanced.

To invoke a rule, start the program with the ID inside [refCheck XYZ]

eg:
scprefchecker -refCheck loottemplate

-> The program will look inside the file "refChecker.conf" and
   execute [refCheck loottemplate] 

Feel free to implement your own rules and share.
