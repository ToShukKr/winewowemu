In your world of warcraft directory (for example d:\world of warcraft), delete WoW.exe.
Once you done that, download http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/WoW/other/Repair.zip
Unzip it and run repair.exe
This will now check what files exists, the version of it, and looks what files are missing.
Once its done, you will see when you start WoW again its version 1.1.2
