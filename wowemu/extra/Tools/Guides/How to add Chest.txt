1- Type: .addspawn 
2- Select the spawn and type: .setspawngo # (#=game object number) 
3- Select the spawn and type: .setspawndist #1 #2 (#1=minimum distance and #2 = max distance, use "0 0" to make it spawn on the spawnpoint allways) 
4- Select the spawn and type: .setspawntime 360 560 (random between 360 and 560 seconds, use 360 360 to make it spawn every 360 sec.) 

If the gameojbect is spawned, go close to is and use .targetgo 
Then use .info to get the number for that object. (entry=? -I think)  

It is not hard once you do it some times.
